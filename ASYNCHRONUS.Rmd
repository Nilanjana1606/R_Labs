##INTRODUCTION :

Two bonding agents, A and B, are available for making a laminated beam. Out of 50 beams
made with Agent A, 11 failed a stress test, whereas 19 of the 50 beams made with Agent B failed.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## BOTH-TAILED TEST

H0: p1=p2
vs
H1: p1!=p2

```{r}
x=c(11,19)
n=c(50,50)
prop.test(x, n, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```
##CONCLUSION : We accept null hypothesis(p-value >0.05),that is, the proportion at which the laminated beams failed to work for Agents A and B, are equal.


##LEFT TAILED TEST

H0: p1=p2
vs
H1: p1<p2


```{r}
x=c(11,19)
n=c(50,50)
prop.test(x, n, alternative = "less", conf.level = 0.95)
```
##CONCLUSION : We accept null hypothesis (p-value >0.05),that is, the proportion at which the laminated beams failed to work for Agents A and B, are equal.
